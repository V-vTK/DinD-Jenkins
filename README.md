Inside Triggers either use Poll SCM, which are timed (not reccomended) or use Github hooks.

If Jenkins is running behind CloudFlare middleware Github hook IP addresses have to be bypassed for commit hooks. IP addresses can be found [here](https://api.github.com/meta). The resulting rule should look something like this:

Next, configure webhooks for your repository:

The rebuild should now trigger after each commit to main branch. Jenkins reports build reason as "Started by Github push by ..."

It's reccomended that the pipeline script is configured inside the repository:
